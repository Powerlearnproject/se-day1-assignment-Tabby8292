# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is all about writing instructions ,building apps,games,websites,solving real word problems using technology
Software  engineering is important because
-ensure software perform as expected
-ensure the system can handle an increased load e
-help optimize developers workflow

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Matering  complexity-
2.Mastering process
3.Mastering machine
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-identify everything requiredin a software
2.Requirement analysis-identify final user specification
3.Design-build a framework
4.Coding-write your instructions or comands
5.Testing-examine the software for any bug and glitches 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.waterfall has low flexibility while agile has high flexibility
2.Waterfall is linear and sequential while agile isiteratile and incremental
3.In waterfall testing is done at the end of the development process while agile testing is continuous and done after each iteration
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software developer
-Maintain and updating software to keep it functional
-report to project managerabout the progress of software devvelopment
2.Quality assurance Engineer
-Create development standardand procedures for the programmers to follow
-confirm that the software meets the requirements before deployment
3.Project managers
-Assembles and lead the software development team
-Create blueprint for the project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE
-Format the written text
-make suggestins to complete a code statement
-Increase programming productivity
VCS
-Enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflict
-Records detailed history of changes
-Allow retriving to previous version if new changes introduce error
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Time constrains-streamline workflow
-Limited infrastructure-
-Changing softwae requirements
-Software security

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit test are tests that consist of testing individual methods,functions of the class,modules
intergration test are tests that verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
promp engineering is ia the process where you guide generative AI solution to generate desired output
importance 
-increase flexibility
-Improve use   experiences
-develop control


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
